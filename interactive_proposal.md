## Topic: 
Exploring the Relationship between School Districts and Housing Prices in Chicago

## Description: 
The relationship between housing prices and public school quality is a key factor for families, investors, and urban planners. In Chicago, where neighborhoods vary significantly in terms of socioeconomic factors, understanding this relationship within neighborhood school attendance boundaries offers valuable insights. This project will use an interactive map to visualize school districts’ housing prices, along with demographic data, school performance, and other relevant factors. The map will enable users to click on specific districts to explore deeper insights, including detailed demographic profiles, housing data, and population density trends.


## Data Source:

### 1. Chicago Public Schools (CPS) District Data
URL: [Chicago Public Schools (CPS) District Data](https://www.cps.edu/about/district-data/)

Description: Contains school performance metrics, demographic information, and enrollment data, offering insights into each school district’s educational quality and student demographics.

### 2. City of Chicago Data Portal:
URL: [City of Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)

Description: Provides access to various datasets, including school attendance boundaries, demographic information, housing prices, and building permits.

## Proposed Visualization Examples:

### 1. Interactive Map with Drill-Down Features

Example: [The Ocean Clean up](https://theoceancleanup.com/sources/)

Description: The map will display Chicago’s school district boundaries, with color coding to represent housing price trends. By clicking on a district, users will see details about demographics, school performance, and average housing prices. This allows for in-depth exploration of each district.

I think Option A fits the best for this visualization.

### 2. Map with Population Movement Simulation

Example:[A Day in the Life of Americans](https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/)

Description: A little bit like the simulation of time using, but with map as the base. The user may be able to filter or adjust factors like housing prices or school quality and observe how populations might relocate.

I think Option A also fits the best for this visualization.

## Questions:

1. For the second visualization idea, I am not quite sure how to do the simulation. I think it is possible but not quite sure how...?
2. Should the simulation focus on current(most recent) conditions, or would adding historical data to show past movements provide a stronger narrative?
3. Are there recommended D3.js libraries or methods for displaying demographic data and housing prices together on a map?
