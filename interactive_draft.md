# School Quality vs. Home Prices: Mapping Chicago's Neighborhoods

Yi-Huai Chang

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

The current goal of this project is to provide an overview

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
There are some changes since the proposal:
1. Data scources: Chicago data portal didn't provide much information on housing data, especially 
for the sale prices in the housing market. Therefore, I found a new data source called Redfin, which is a  real estate brokerage, and they have direct access to data from local multiple listing services.
2. The level of the data: It is hard to aggregate housing prices data to school district level if we didn't 
have individual(property) level data. I decided to use Chicago community areas as sth sth and the audience can see the distribution for three different sth sth.

There are two main challenges that I am facing right now. The first one is that some areas don't have housing price data or graduation rate data. Especially for graduation rate, since the dataset I collected is only for district schools, some schools, which may affect the distribution a lot, are not included. Thanks to Michael, he gave me advice on using the other dataset on CPS after the critique meeting, so I might look into that.

I am not using a mock dataset.

## Walk us through an interaction, either in words or you can record a quick 2-3 minute video.

First you can choose which catogory that you want to look at by selecting the drop down list.
In three maps, you can all see the detail information about the area by clicking the area.
Also, there is a "More about this area" hyperlink in each popup box, which will link to the section below that shows the race and ethnicity composition about this area. 


## Questions

1. If I want to show comparision between different categories, I might put two maps side by side instead of using a dropdown to select and only showing one of three category at a time. How do I make it more readable since I have three categories instead of two?

2. I feel like for this project I don't need a lot of details on maps. Should I just switch to d3? Or maybe can I just turn off the base layer?
