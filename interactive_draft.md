# School Quality vs. Home Prices: Mapping Chicago's Neighborhoods

Yi-Huai Chang

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

The current goal of this project is to provide an overview of housing prices and education in Chicago neighborhoods. In the proposal, I planned to visualize school districtsâ€™ housing prices along with other factors such as demographics and school performance. However, using school districts as the level of the data is hard for data collection and processing. Therefore, I decided to base the map on the offical Chicago community areas, so that the audience can clearly see the distribution for three different categories of population, graduation rate, and median sale price.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

Chicago data portal didn't provide much information on housing data, especially 
for the sale prices in the housing market. Therefore, I found a new data source called Redfin, which is a  real estate brokerage, and they have direct access to data from local multiple listing services.

There are two main challenges that I am facing right now. The first one is that some areas don't have housing price data or graduation rate data. Especially for graduation rate, since the dataset I collected is only for district schools, some schools, which may affect the distribution a lot, are not included. Thanks to Michael, he gave me advice on using the other dataset on CPS after the critique meeting, so I might look into that.

I am not using a mock data.

## Walk us through an interaction, either in words or you can record a quick 2-3 minute video.

First you can choose which catogory that you want to look at by selecting the drop down list.
In three maps, you can all see the detail information about the area by clicking the area.
Also, there is a "More about this area" hyperlink in each popup box, which will link to the section below that shows the race and ethnicity composition about this area. 


## Questions

1. If I want to show comparision between different categories, I might put two maps side by side instead of using a dropdown to select and only showing one of three category at a time. How do I make it more readable since I have three categories instead of two?

2. I feel like for this project I don't need a lot of details on maps. Should I just switch to d3? Or maybe can I just turn off the base layer?
